<p>Loads quickly through initial menus and allows you to create a character in Play (Offline). Finished creating a character and then hung completely on character selection menu and did not let me start a game.</p>
<p>On a second try, the original saved character was present and it allowed me through to create a universe and begin loading a game. Crashed after the cutscene > load screen.
On a third try it crashed at the same place.</p>
<p>On a fourth try I tried "Local Play" menu item. This crashed right after choosing to continue in the universe I'd created earlier. It did not play the cutscene nor reach the load screen.</p>
<p>New, more descriptive error in 1.0.4683</p>
