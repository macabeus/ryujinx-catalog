Loads quickly through initial menus and allows you to create a character in Play (Offline). Finished creating a character and then hung completely on character selection menu and did not let me start a game.

On a second try, the original saved character was present and it allowed me through to create a universe and begin loading a game. Crashed after the cutscene > load screen.
On a third try it crashed at the same place.

On a fourth try I tried "Local Play" menu item. This crashed right after choosing to continue in the universe I'd created earlier. It did not play the cutscene nor reach the load screen.

New, more descriptive error in 1.0.4683
